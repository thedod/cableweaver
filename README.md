CableWeaver uses [d3](http://d3js.org) to let interactively examine [Cable2Graph](http://wlwardiary.github.com/cable2graph/) cable reference culsters.
You can see a live demo [here](http://thedod.github.com/cableweaver).

Note that all files are static (about 150MB of json), so you can easily download the whole thing,
and either put it on your own public server, or even browse this from your own computer.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thedod/cableweaver/wiki) for user instructions and "under the hood" issues.
